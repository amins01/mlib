# MLIB - Machine Learning from Scratch

This library is a collection of fundamental machine learning algorithms and tools implemented from scratch using only numpy.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Uses nearest neighbors to make a prediciton (classification and regression tasks).
- **Linear Regression**: Fits a line or hyperplane to the data to make predictions (regression tasks).
- **Logistic Regression**: Uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function (cross-entropy) to find the best parameters for the sigmoid function (classification tasks).
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: A simple neural network with 1 hidden layer (classification and regression tasks).
- **Naive Bayes**: Uses Bayes' theorem (assuming feature independence) to make predictions (classification tasks).

## Upcoming Algorithms

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machine
- XGBoost
- k-Means Clustering

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains small scripts showing the usage of each algorithm implemented in this library.
